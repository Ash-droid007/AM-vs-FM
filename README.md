# AM-vs-FM
Visual Explanation of the difference between AM &amp; FM (By Ashriyah)
This project demonstrates the basic difference between Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM).

AM (Amplitude Modulation): Carrier amplitude varies with the signal.

FM (Frequency Modulation): Carrier frequency varies with the signal.

Useful for understanding the fundamentals of communication systems.
